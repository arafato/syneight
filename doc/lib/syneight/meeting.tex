%
% Meeting agenda and protocol 'environment'.
% 
% Author: cbs
% 
% This is a new meeting 'environment' which replaces the old one.
% 
% Here is an example of a agenda/protocol in the new format:
% 
% ----------------------------------------
% 
% \input{syneight/meeting.tex}
% 
% \begin{document}
% 
% \setTitle{Sample Meeting}
% 
% % set further title page information (omitted in this example)
% 
% \meetingtitlepage
% 
% \agenda
% 
% \topic{Topic 1}{10}
% 
% % topic content
% 
% \topic{Topic 2}{15}
% 
% % topic content
% 
% \protocol
% 
% \topic{Topic 1}{12}
% 
% % topic content
% 
% \topic{Topic 2}{14}
% 
% % topic content
% 
% \end{document}
% 
% ----------------------------------------
% 
% I think this is a little easier to use than the previous
% environment, since the document structure is now really simple.
% 
% Basically, I dropped all the "paperversion" stuff, thus removing the
% agenda/protocol summary. If anybody found those really useful, I'm
% sorry, but in my opinion, these are not really necessary. The agenda
% should not be more than one or two pages long anyway, so there is no
% real need for an extra summary, and the protocol does not need a
% summary at all.
% 
% The main advantage of the new environment is, that content within
% "topics" (formerly "issues", but the command \issue seemingly already
% exists somewhere in latex) can be any valid latex-code (e.g. a
% "verbatim" environment). This is because the content is no longer
% passed as an argument to the command. The structural commands are now
% more like "section"/"subsection" commands.
% 
% In contrast to the old environment, the content of topics is no longer
% restricted to a list of 'subissues', but can be anything the author
% wants to put there.
% 
% Topic headers are still numbered and contain time tracking information
% (start, stop and duration in minutes).
% 
% The title page now contains only a table with general information
% about the meeting (title, date, time, participants, ...). This
% information is set via \setXXX commands (see below) and then displayed
% with the \meetingtitlepage command.
% 
% I also added a command and environment for making notes: \note and
% 'longnote'-environment. These should be used for information that was
% not actually discussed during the meeting, but was added later to the
% protocol.
