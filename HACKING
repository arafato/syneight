How to add new files to the build system
----------------------------------------

If you want to add a new file to the Syneight build system do the following:

 * If there's already a Makefile.am in the directory:
     * List your file in the Makefile.am by adding it to
       * foo_SOURCES (it it's a source file)
       * foo_HEADERS (if it's a header file)
     * If you want to, you can re-run 'bootstrap' in the top-level
       Syneight directory. This *should* be unnecessary with automake 1.8
       and above, as it should automatically detect your changes and
       re-run configure et. al. for you, where needed.

 * If there's no Makefile.am in the directory:
     * Copy an existing Makefile.am from another source directory and adapt it.
     * You *at least* need to change:
         * SUBDIRS (which subdirectories to process, if any)
         * bin_PROGRAMS, if an excecutable program is to be built in this dir.
         * foo_SOURCES and foo_HEADERS: List all source/header files here.
     * Add a new line in AC_CONFIG_FILES in configure.ac, so that configure
       knows that it should create a new Makefile using your newly created
       Makefile.am.
     * Re-run 'bootstrap' in the top-level Syneight directory.

 * If you add intermediate directories, which don't contain any files, but
   only subdirectories:
     * Copy another Makefile.am from such an intermediate directory and
       adapt it.
     * You *at least* need to change:
         * SUBDIRS (which subdirectories to process, if any)
     * Add a new line in AC_CONFIG_FILES in configure.ac, so that configure
       knows that it should create a new Makefile using your newly created
       Makefile.am.
     * Re-run 'bootstrap' in the top-level Syneight directory.

 * Test the build:
    * $ cd build/audit
      $ ../../configure --enable-buildtype=audit
      $ make
    * This should work, if it doesn't, fix it.

 * Test the build again. Just to be sure.
    * In the top-level Syneight directory do:
      $ cd build/audit
      $ make maintainer-clean
      $ cd ../..
      $ rm -rf build/audit/*
      $ svn up
      $ ./bootstrap
      $ cd build/audit
      $ ../../configure --enable-buildtype=audit
      $ make
    * If this still works, you could be lucky.

 * Add your new files to svn:
    * Run 'svn diff' in the top-level Syneight directory. If you use vim,
      you could do a 'svn diff | vim -', other editors might also have
      some handy way to do this.
    * Check that you only changed what you wanted to change, and that you
      only commit what you really wanted to commit.
    * Run 'svn ci'.
    * Write a useful, verbose comment and explain *why* you added which
      files (no need to list them *all*, svn does that for you) and what
      they are used for.
